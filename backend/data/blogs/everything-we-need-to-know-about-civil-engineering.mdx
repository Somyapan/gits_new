Are you someone who has a strong urge to contribute towards the development of the world? Why don’t you dream of becoming a civil engineer?

If you ever felt like contributing to the world by building a bridge, road, or building; civil engineering is something you should pursue. A civil engineer is someone proficient in designing, planning, and executing the construction of buildings, bridges, roads, drainage, airports, and other large-scale public works. In this blog, we will learn everything we need to know about civil engineering in India.

But before learning about the scope of civil engineering in India, you need to know that civil engineering works only when you pursue it from a reputed and firm college in your region. For consideration, if you are residing in Udaipur, and planning to pursue civil engineering in Udaipur. Choose from the [best civil engineering colleges in Udaipur](https://gits.ac.in). A renowned college plays a vital role in building the future base of the student.

## What are the subjects a civil engineer should know?

Since civil engineering is all about construction and execution, a civil engineer should know how to use the technical aspects of physics, mathematics, and material science to design and build infrastructure that is sufficient and efficient. Besides, civil engineers are also proficient in ensuring regulatory requirements and environmental guidelines. They should also have good communication skills to ensure seamless conversation with clients understanding their requirements and needs.

## Is there any scope for civil engineering in India?

Civil engineering is indeed a vast subject. Civil engineering applies a wide range from designing and building infrastructure to maintaining it. With the advent of computer engineering generation Z believes that the scope of civil engineering is apparently declining in India. But no, with its multiple sub-disciples civil engineering is still blooming worldwide.

## What are the sub-disciplines of civil engineering?

The sub-disciplines of civil engineering are described as follows:

### 1. Structural Engineering

Structural engineering is the sub-discipline of civil engineering that deals with the design and analysis of infrastructure structures. This may be a building, bridge, tunnel, or dam. As suggested by the name, the structural civil engineer works on the structure of infrastructure and works to grant stability and durability to that structure.

### 2. Geotechnical Engineering

Geotechnical engineering is the sub-disciple of geotechnical engineering that includes the study of soil mechanics and foundation engineering. Civil engineers who study geotechnical engineering are primarily concerned with the behavior of soil and rock. Geotechnical civil engineers analyze the earth’s support system to construct infrastructure like fountains, highways, retaining walls, and embankments.

### 3. Transportation Engineering

As an emerging discipline of civil engineering, transportation engineering deals with the design, manufacturing, and operation of transportation. Transportation civil engineers work to create a system for better control of vehicular vehicles. Their major work includes planning and layout of highways, harbors, railways, and other mass transportation systems.

### 4. Environmental Engineering

As the name suggests environmental civil engineering focuses on the design and implementation of applications for protecting and managing the environment. These engineers bring into application the principles of engineering, soil science, and chemistry to improve the overall environmental quality.  Their major contribution includes measuring pollutants and supervising the operation of freshwater and wastewater treatment.

### 5. Geodetic Engineering

Geodetic Engineering has emerged recently in the last few decades. Geodetic engineers are concerned with mapping and measuring the earth’s surface. Their knowledge is applied to locating property and building lines.

### 6. Materials Engineering

Serving as a base for all other branches of civil engineering, material engineering focuses on the study of the properties of construction materials. Further, this knowledge is applied while application of the material in construction.

### 7. Hydraulic Engineering

Another sub-division of civil engineering is hydraulic engineering. Also known as water resources engineers, hydraulic engineers are concerned with water and its flowing properties. Applying the principles of fluid mechanics, hydraulic engineers deal with the planning and designing of dams, irrigation systems, drainage control systems, and urban water tasks.

## How much is a civil engineer paid in India?

Overall, civil engineering plays a critical role in shaping the physical infrastructure of our society and improving the quality of life for people around the world. The average annual salary of an experienced civil engineer in his middle career is around 5-6 LPA. A top experienced civil engineer in India may earn more than 10 LPA.

## Where should I pursue civil engineering in Udaipur?

You should always choose one of the best civil engineering colleges in Udaipur. For consideration, Geetanjali Institute of Technical Studies, GITS Udaipur is a renowned and popular name in civil engineering in Udaipur. With the top placement records in Rajasthan, Geetanjali Institute of Technical Studies (GITS) is a perfect start to building your career in [civil engineering in Udaipur](https://gits.ac.in).
